# radish_squah_mushroom_lettuce
An attempt to predict price changes in Runescape using Machine Learning.

I've written a parser for Runesape Wiki GE item price data.
The parser converts the datea to a pandas array.
Then, we train a model on the data and evaluate it.

Currently, I've attempted to predict the next price change for saradomin brew (4).
My RMSE is currently around 7 percentage points.
